This file documents the incompatibilities to Tcl8.6 in the published API,
as seen by scripts, tcl.h, tcl.decls and tclInt.decls. Other changes in
tclInt.h are not listed.

* TIP280 and [info frame] do not exist anymore. Some changes in tclInt.decls.

* compile flags USE_TCLALLOC and USE_THREAD_ALLOC are ignored

* Tcl_CallFrame is gone (was in tcl.h!); some CallFrame manips (push, pop)
  are gone from tclInt.decls (more to come)

* allocator API is gone from tclInt.decls: no more obj or stack allocation
  accessible from outside,TclpAlloc and friends are gone too

* There is no more direct evaluation, averything goes through bytecodes
  (except for canonical lists). TCL_EVAL_DIRECT is simply ignored.
