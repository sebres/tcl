 * TclMSB --
 *
 *	Given a size_t non-zero value n, return the index of the most
 *	significant bit in n that is set.  This is equivalent to returning
 *	trunc(log2(n)).  It's also equivalent to the largest integer k
 *	such that 2^k <= n.
 *
 *	This routine is adapted from Andrej Brodnik, "Computation of the
 *	Least Significant Set Bit", pp 7-10, Proceedings of the 2nd
 *	Electrotechnical and Computer Science Conference, Portoroz,
 *	Slovenia, 1993.  The adaptations permit the computation to take
 *	place within size_t values without the need for double length
 *	buffers for calculation.  They also fill in a number of details
 *	the paper omits or leaves unclear.
 *
 * Results:
 *	The index of the most significant set bit in n, a value between
 *	0 and CHAR_BIT*sizeof(size_t) - 1, inclusive.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	None.
