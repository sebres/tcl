# Tcl/Tk 9.0b2 Release Announcement
April ??, 2024

The Tcl Core Team is pleased to announce the 9.0b2 releases of the Tcl
dynamic language and the Tk graphical interface package.  These are the
second beta releases of Tcl 9.0 and Tk 9.0.  More details can be found below.

We would like to express our gratitude to all those who submit bug
reports and patches.  This information is invaluable in enabling us
to identify and eliminate problems in the core. Such reports can be
submitted here.

## <a id="wheretoget">1.</a> Where to get the new releases

Tcl/Tk 9.0b2 sources are freely available as open source from the Tcl
SourceForge project's file distribution area:

        https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/files/

This distribution is source code only.  We keep links to some third
parties offering pre-built binaries for various systems here:

        https://www.tcl-lang.org/software/tcltk/bindist.html

## <a id="summary">2.</a> General Summary

These are new major versions of both Tcl and Tk.  There are new features
to be enjoyed.  There are incompatibilities to be considered. The list
of both is long and detailed and not fully included here.  We believe many
scripts written for Tcl 8 will run unchanged in Tcl 9.  We believe many more
can be modified in small and simple ways to produce a new script that runs
in both Tcl 8 and Tcl 9.  We expect that extensions and applications using
the public C APIs of Tcl and Tk will involve more effort, but that it is
still within reasonable reach to produce source code supporting both Tcl 8
and Tcl 9 while both releases remain in widespread use.

These are beta releases.  The developers believe the new feature set is
complete enough and the code quality is high enough that it is time for
a larger audience of Tcl/Tk users to give them a try and report back
to the developers what difficulties need resolution before stable
releases of Tcl/Tk 9.0.0.

The experiences of Tcl/Tk 8 users adapting their code to the beta releases
of Tcl/Tk 9 will shape the final interfaces of Tcl/Tk 9.0.0, and will
determine the need for possible Tcl/Tk 8.7 releases that might supply
additional lifecycle and migration support.

It is not recommended to deploy these beta releases directly to mission
critical use without significant testing and review.

## <a id="tips">4.</a> Tcl Improvement Proposals (TIPs)

Each new user-visible feature in Tcl or Tk should find its origins in
a Tcl Improvement Proposal (TIP).  TIPs are published, edited, considered
and voted in public, and should contain valuable information about how
a feature came to be the way it is.  See the full collection here:

    https://tip.tcl-lang.org/

## <a id="support">5.</a> Additional support resources

https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/wiki?name=Migrating+scripts+to+Tcl+9

There has been much progress already porting many known applications,
extensions, and packages in the Tcl world to compatibility with Tcl/Tk 9:
