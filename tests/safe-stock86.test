# safe-stock86.test --
#
# This file contains tests for safe Tcl that were previously in the file
# safe.test, and use files and packages of stock Tcl 8.6 to perform the tests.
# These files may be changed or disappear in future revisions of Tcl,
# for example package http 1.0 will be removed from Tcl 8.7.
#
# The tests are replaced in safe.tcl with tests that use files provided in the
# tests directory.  Test numbering is for comparison with similar tests in
# safe.test.
#
# Sourcing this file into tcl runs the tests and generates output for errors.
# No output means no errors were found.
