# Design of Tcl string values for Tcl 9

## DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS. NOT (YET) NORMATIVE

All Tcl values are strings, but what is a string?

The aim of this document is to spell out what the answer to that question
has been, what it should be, and how we get from one to the other.

## Fundamentals

A ***string*** is a sequence of zero or more symbols, each ***symbol***
a member of a symbol set known as an ***alphabet***.  For example, the
Tcl string **cat** is the sequence of three symbols **c**, **a**, **t**.

Each symbol in the Tcl alphabet is associated with a non-negative integer,
known as the ***code*** of that symbol.  Distinct symbols have distinct
codes.  Schemes that associate symbols with code values are known
as ***character sets***.  For example, in Tcl's character set, the
symbols **c**, **a**, and **t** are associated with code
values 99, 97, and 116 respectively.

There is an ordering imposed on the alphabet by the numeric order of
the associated code values.  This ordering allows symbols to be compared
and sorted.  The natural extension of that ordering to sequences
establishes one well defined way to compare, order and sort string values.

The number of symbols in a string's symbol sequence is the ***length***
of that string.  

A symbol within a string can be identified by its place in the sequence,
counting with an ***index*** that starts at 0.  A string of length *N*
has a symbol at each of the index values 0 through *N*-1.  We can
represent the symbol found at index *i* within string *s* with the
notation *s*[*i*].

Given a string *s* of length *N*, every pair of an index
value *i*, 0 <= *i* <= *N*, and a length *L*, 0 <= *L* <= *N* - *i*,
defines a substring of *s* of length *L* built from the sequence
of symbols *s*[*i*], ..., *s*[*i* + *L* - 1]. These substrings are also
rooted to a particular location in the original string.

Given a string *s* of length *M* and a string *t* of length *N*, the
concatenation of *s* and *t* is the string *u* of length *L* = *M* + *N*,
with *u*[0] = *s*[0], ... *u*[*M* - 1] = *s*[*M* - 1],
*u*[*M*] = *t*[0], ... *u*[*L* - 1] = *t*[*N* - 1].

In all of these descriptions, the string values act in ways with a
direct analog to C arrays of integer values.  This is a familiar collection
of behaviors that a broad collection of programmers can successfully reason
about without extensive training in the complexities of character
sets and encodings.  The basics are accessible to even novice programmers.
*Make the easy things easy; make the harder things possible.*

To be able to create and store an arbitrary string, a Tcl interpreter has
the minimum need for a set of commands or substitutions with the primitive
abilities to create an empty string, to create each string of length 1
(one for each symbol in the alphabet), and the ability to concatenate
arbitrary strings.  Other important primitives are the ability to report
the length of a string, index into a string, take a substring from a
string, and compare symbols and strings.  

## Tcl strings as the universal value set

We most frequently think of strings as a data type with the purpose of
entering, creating, storing, manipulating, processing and producing
text.  In Tcl, though, string values also serve as the universal value
set.  If a value cannot be expressed as a Tcl string, it is not a Tcl value.
The representations of other value sets in Tcl is in large part an exercise
in creating schemes to encode the values of those other value sets in
the form of Tcl strings.  Because of that, we want the set of Tcl strings
to permit encodings of other value sets that are clear, simple, efficient
and convenient.  The history of growing Tcl's alphabet has been driven by
the desire to better provide for a encoding another value set not easily
accommodate by the legacy alphabet.

## Tcl alphabet versions

In Tcl 7, the alphabet for Tcl strings was a set of symbols associated
with code values 1 through 255.  This is exactly the set
of **NUL**-terminated C strings.  The symbols with code values 1 through 127
are defined to follow the ASCII character set.  The symbols with code
values 128 through 255 were less stringently specified, but such symbols
could nevertheless be reliably created, stored, processed and produced by
Tcl programs.  This set of string values continues to have relevance in
Tcl today, because it is exactly this set that can be passed as arguments
to Tcl commands defined via Tcl_CreateCommand().
